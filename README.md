# FooDine
FooDine

Concept: The app is created to serve the food ordering market and can be a direct competitor to companies like Food Panda. 

The final version of the app (which we will present at the end of the session) intends to fill the following market gaps. 

Allow the user to choose from a list of restaurants
Show the list of food categories in any given restaurant (drop down)
Show the list of food items in any given category
Allow the person to place order in quantity of his choice
See the order cart before confirming the order
Shoot a mail or SMS to a given phone number of email ID as an order confirmation

Each of the above intents will have sub objectives and mile stones. Since the project is not being imported into Github which is a version control platform for all open source projects (like the one we are building), We will add all the further tas ks and milestones on the same. 

Request all of you to install Github for Windows/Linux based on the preference of your OS and your IDE. In case you are not comfortable doing it alone, we can do it first thing we meet.
